	<LongDescription>
Achievement Fixer activates in game achievements system even if the game is started with mods installed. Normally CS2 disables all achievements if it detects any mods are installed.
How it works:
- just install it and play the game normally while you rack up achievements.

Advanced tab: has several features if you want to do more.
- Unlock achievement: select the achievement you want and unlock it which will mark it as completed
- Reset achievement: clear or reset the selected achievement to mark it as **not completed**
- if you make a mistake, just use  [Unlock] or [Reset] as needed.

Debug options:
- Reset All Achievements button clears out all achievements so they are all marked as "not complete".
This is good for testing and debugging. If you use this by accident, you can always restore some achievements using [Unlock].
