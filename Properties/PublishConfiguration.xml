	<LongDescription>## Achievement Fixer
Keeps the achievements active even when you have mods.

### How it works
* Just keep it installed - no set up needed.
* Re-enables achievements after any city is loaded or switched.
* Replaces the in-game warning ("Achievements are disabled because of mods").

### Notes
* Safe to remove any time; does not touch saves.
* Remove any other "achievement" mods to avoid conflicts.
* Prevents **future** misses by keeping the achievement flag `true`. Game doesn’t retroactively grant past progress.
* Mod does not use Reflection or Harmony; safer and less likely to break with game updates.

### 11+ languages
* English, Français French, Deutsch German, Español Spanish, Italiano Italian
* 日本語 Japanese, 한국어 Korean, 简体中文 Simplified Chinese, 繁體中文 Traditional Chinese
* Polski Polish, Português Brazilian Portuguese
* WIP: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)

### Support and Feedback
* If the mod helps you, give it a Like :)
* Report issues on Github link or Discord `Achievement Fixer` channel.
* Also see the Forum link.

### Advanced tab
- Past things done before installing the mod, the game will not suddenly give you the achievement.
- You'll need to re-trigger the condition in-game again from scratch (Keep this mod installed, and just do same things again). 
Or use the mod's Advanced buttons (you met the condition before, you deserve it).
