	<LongDescription># Achievement Fixer
Keeps the CS2 achievements active even when you have mods.

## How it works
* Automatically re-enables achievements after a city loads.
* Just install the mod, start earning achievements naturally.
* Stops the in-game warning ("Achievements are disabled because of mods").
* Uses the game’s built-in localization to show readable names.

## Notes
* Safe to remove at any time; does not touch saves.
* Some achievements shown on Steam are not available until DLCs are released (e.g., 6 from Bridges and Ports).
* This mod does not use Reflection or Harmony, so it's safe/compatible, and less likely to break with every game update.

## Supports 9+ languages
* English, Français (French), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Italiano (Italian), 日本語 (Japanese)
* 한국어 (Korean), Português (Brasil) (Brazilian Portuguese), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese).
* Future updates may add more languages. WIP: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)

## Advanced tab
* If you want faster (don't like natural), go to the Advanced tab.
