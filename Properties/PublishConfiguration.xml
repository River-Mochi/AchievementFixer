	<LongDescription># Achievement Fixer
Keeps the achievements active even when you have mods.

## How it works
* Just install the mod, nothing else needed, it works automatically.
* Stops the in-game warning ("Achievements are disabled because of mods").
* Re-enables achievements after any city loads or is switched.

## Notes
* Some achievements shown on Steam are not available until DLCs are released (e.g., 6 from Bridges and Ports DLC).
* Safe to remove at any time; does not touch saves.
* This mod does not use Reflection or Harmony; safe/compatible, less likely to break with game updates.
* Avoid using any other Achievement mods at the same time.

### Supports 9+ languages
* English, Français (French), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Italiano (Italian), 日本語 (Japanese)
* 한국어 (Korean), Português (Brasil) (Brazilian Portuguese), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese).
* Future updates may add more languages. WIP: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)
