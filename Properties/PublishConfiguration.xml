	<LongDescription># Achievement Fixer
Keeps the achievements active even when you have mods.

# UPDATED for 1.3.6* and Bridges DLC

## How it works
* Just install the mod, nothing else needed, it works automatically.
* Stops the in-game warning ("Achievements are disabled because of mods").
* Re-enables achievements after any city loads or is switched.

## Notes
* Safe to remove at any time.
* Remove any other "achievement" mods which may cause conflicts.
* mod prevents **future** misses by flipping the flag `true`. it doesn’t retroactively grant past events.
* This mod does not use Reflection or Harmony; safe/compatible, less likely to break with game updates.

### Supports 11+ languages
* English, Français (French), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Italiano (Italian)
* 日本語 (Japanese), 한국어 (Korean), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese)
* Polski (Polish), Português (Brasil) (Brazilian Portuguese)
* Future updates may add more languages. WIP: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)

### Support and Feedback
* If the mod helps you, give it a Like :)
* Report issues to the Github link is best. or discord `Achievement Fixer` channel: https://discord.gg/HTav7ARPs2
* There is also a Forum link for this mod.

### Advanced tab
- Past things done before installing the mod, the game will not suddenly give you the achievement.
- When the game flipped 'achievementsEnabled = false' when a player 'originally' satisfied a condition, that unlock isn't recorded.
- You need to re-trigger the condition in-game again from scratch (install this mod, keep it installed, and just do same things again). 
Or use the mod's Advanced buttons (if you feel like you deserve it now and can't wait). Reload the game if Steam is not updated.
