	<LongDescription>
Achievement Fixer keeps the CS2 achievements active even when you have mods.

**How it works**
- Automatically re-enables achievements after a city loads.
- Stops the in-game warning ("Achievements are disabled because of mods").
- Uses the game’s own localization to show friendly achievement names.
- Just having the mod installed allows you to earn achievements natually if you want the challenge.
- If you want faster, see the Advanced tab.

**Advanced tab**
- [Unlock Selected] marks a chosen achievement as completed.
- [Clear Selected]  resets one achievement (back to not completed).
- [Debug: Reset All] wipes out all achievements (useful for testing). If you click this by accident, just use [Unlock Selected] to restore them.

Supports 10 languages:
- English, Français (French), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Italiano (Italian), 日本語 (Japanese)
- 한국어 (Korean), Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese), Português (Brasil) (Brazilian Portuguese), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese).
- Future updates may add more languages.

**Notes**
- Some achievements shown on Steam are not available until DLC's are released (e.g., 6 from Bridges & Ports).
- Safe to remove at any time; does not touch saves.
- This mod does not use Reflection or Harmony, so it's safe/compatible, and less likely to break with every game update.

**Credits**
- made by RiverMochi
- inspired by Wayze's old Achievement Enabler (defunct)
- Thanks to StarQ and the modding community for technical help and testing.
