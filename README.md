# Achievement Fixer

## Goal
- Keep achievements working in Cities Skylines II even when the game is started with mods.
  - Active mods (not assets) will normally disqualify a save game for acheivement completion.
- Complete the tasks to get the [achievement](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Achievements), this enables the chance to get them.
- City switching: checks each time a city finishes loading, so this mod works even when switching saves.
- Ingame warning fix: this mod will stop the warning display of "Achievements are disabled because of mods."
- Language switching: works even if you switch languages by reading the appropriate game localization dictionary.

### Parameters:
- Just install the mod, EnableAchievements is ON by default, nothing extra needs to be done.
- Do the natural things required, e.g., build 10 parks in a single city to get "Groundskeeper".
- Safe to remove anytime as it does not touch saves.
- Six additional achievements shown on Steam can not be acquired until Bridges & Ports DLC is released.
- **Bonus options on the Advanced tab.**


### Credits
- Inspired by Wayzware's early version of [Achievement Enabler](https://github.com/Wayzware/AchievementEnabler) (no longer works).
- StarQ for technical support
