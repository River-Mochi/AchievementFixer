# Achievement Fixer

## Goal
- Keep achievements working in Cities Skylines II even when the game is started with mods.
  - Active mods (not assets) will normally disqualify a save game for acheivement completion.
- You still need to complete the tasks to get the [achievement](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Achievements), this enables the chance to get them.
- City switching: checks each time a city finishes loading, so this mod works even when switching saves.
- Ingame warning fix: this mod will stop display of the warning "Achievements are disabled because of mods."

## Behavior
- as long as the mod is installed, EnableAchievements will be ON, nothing extra needs to be done.
- This mod is safe to remove anytime as it does not touch saves.

### Parameters:
- You still need to do the natural things required, e.g., build 10 parks in a single city to get "Groundskeeper".

- touch the built-in Achievements tab
- touch any possible DLC achievements for DLCs the player does not own.

### Credits
- Inspired by Wayzware's early version of [Achievement Enabler](https://github.com/Wayzware/AchievementEnabler) (no longer works).
- StarQ for technical support
