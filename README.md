# Achievement Helper

## Goal — Phase 1
- Keep achievements working in Cities Skylines II even when the game is started with mods.
- Active mods (not assets) will normally disqualify a save game for acheivement completion.

## Option menu
- Toggle ☑ lets players disable the mod even if it's installed.
- do not disable the mod if you want it to work.

### This mod does not:
- automatically give you the achievement, you still need to do the natural things required, e.g., build 10 parks in a single city to get "Groundskeeper".
- change the in-game UI text that claims “Achievements disabled…” (that’s a separate UI-side issue).
    - achievements will still be enabled even if you see that text.
- touch the built-in Achievements tab
- touch any possible DLC achievements for DLCs the player does not own.
