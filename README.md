# Achievement Fixer

Keep achievements working in **Cities: Skylines II** even when playing with mods.  
This keeps the game from disabling the achievements backend.

## What it does
- **Enables achievements** even if mods are loaded.
  - Active mods (not assets) will normally disqualify any achievement completion.
- **City switching:** this mod works even when switching saves.
- **Fixes the warning banner** “Achievements are disabled because of mods.”
  - by sending a message to localization.
- **Shows friendly achievement names** using the game’s own localization dictionary.
- **Language switching**: works even if you switch languages
  - re-reads the game's locale dictionary.

## How to use
1. Install the mod from Skyve or Paradox Mods.
   - No configuration needed; achievements enabled by default.
2. Do the tasks (e.g., build 10 parks to get *Groundskeeper*).  
3. Safe to remove anytime; this mod doesn’t touch your saves.

## Notes
- Some achievements shown on Steam are not available until DLCs are released (e.g., 6 from Bridges & Ports).
- If an achievement doesn’t pop right away, a game restart sometimes helps (CS2 quirk).

## Supports 10 languages
* English, Français (French), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish), Italiano (Italian), 日本語 (Japanese)
* 한국어 (Korean), Português (Brasil) (Brazilian Portuguese), 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese).
* Drop-down achievement names come from the game, so they match whatever game language you use (VI which does not currently have an in-game dictionary).
* Future updates may add more languages. WIP: Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)

## Advanced tab (optional)
- **Select achievement** →
  - `[Unlock Selected]` immediately marks it completed.
  - `[Clear Selected]`  resets a single achievement (back to not completed).
- `[DEBUG: Reset All]` wipes all achievement progress (useful for testing).  If you click this by accident, you can use the Unlock button to get them back.

## Compatibility
- Safe to remove anytime; does not touch saves.
- This mod does not use Reflection or Harmony, so it's safe/compatible, and less likely to break with every game update.
- Designed to be minimal and conflict-free: we only manage the platform flag and localization.
- Avoid using/installing any other Achievement mods at the same time.
