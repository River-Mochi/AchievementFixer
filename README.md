# Achievement Helper

## Goal — Phase 1
- Keep achievements working in Cities Skylines II even when the game is started with mods.
- Active mods (not assets) will normally disqualify a save game for acheivement completion.
- You still need to complete the tasks to get the [achievement](https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Achievements), this enables the chance to get them.

## Behavior
- Toggle ☑ lets players disable the mod even if it's installed.
- This mod is safe to remove anytime as it does not touch saves.

### This mod does not:
- automatically give you the achievement. You still need to do the natural things required, e.g., build 10 parks in a single city to get "Groundskeeper".
- change the in-game UI text that claims “Achievements disabled…” (that’s a separate UI-side issue).
    - achievements will still be enabled even if you see that text.
- touch the built-in Achievements tab
- touch any possible DLC achievements for DLCs the player does not own.

### Credits
- Inspired by Wayzware's early version of [Achievement Enabler](https://github.com/Wayzware/AchievementEnabler) (no longer works).
- StarQ for technical support
